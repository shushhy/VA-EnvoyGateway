    Notes
        - Static
            IP/port/unix domain socket for each upstream host
        - Strict DNS
            DNS resolve that considers each IP returned as an host for the upstream cluster and all returned IPs should be load balanced to.
            This is async continuous and can be controlled with 'dns_refresh_rate' and 'dns_failure_refresh_rate' if 'respect_dns_ttl' is enabled.
        - Logical DNS
            Same thing as the above but only uses the first ip returned.
